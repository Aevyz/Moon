If you wish to see a live demo, it can be found at [https://t-aevyz.github.io](https://t-aevyz.github.io).

In this series, I hope to show off some of the more advanced features I have managed to implement in Jekyll, that will involve some tinkering around in programming languages, specifically implementing some Javascript combined with Liquid (Spoiler Alert: It's a nightmare to get right).

For beginners I'd advise taking a look at the introduction series of posts I have been doing (and probably will be doing in parallel) that they can find [here](/github_sites/GS-For-Non-Programmers.html).
