## Goal

Goal of this project was to update the Autohotkey script found on the AHK forums and extend it's functionality, so as to provide better integration and easier modability for users.

## Features

Allows the user to input umlauts, Eszett and German style quotation marks seemlessly on a QWERTY keyboard using a modifier key (default: 1).
